* Hadshon news grabber
Grabs the daily audio from [[https://hadshon.edu.gov.il/][hadshon]], a simple news site ran by the Israeli Ministry of Education.
** Usage
Run as a cron job daily to download the news for each day to listen as you please. I use it for language immersion.
** Silence
export PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore:Unverified HTTPS request" should silence it so that you do not get new mail everytime you run a cron job.

** Requirements
requests-html
pyppeteer
